# About this project

This PROJECT is entirely used as hosting repo for a publicized notes I took down during 
the study of Apache Kafka, using Github Pages and `mkdocs`.

It is entirely decoupled from my personal blog due to

1. it is not a blog but a study note
2. it will make the category layers in the blog too nested
3. it is hard to browse and search too

Feel free to discuss in the issues. I have only finished reading the first chapter, 
and I think I have missed out a lot in the past few years.
